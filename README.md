# OpenMM8 - Might & Magic 8 (2001) reimplementation

 - This project is a Unity reimplementation of original Might & Magic 8 RPG
 - Unity 2018.1.1f1 Personal is used
 - No third-party assets are currently used
## Current State
 - Original maps are loadable
 - Semi-Working basic GUI (Working minimap + player arrow, working Compas)
 - Working mechanism of animating / rotating NPCs - they are actually 8-sided 2D sprites, not 3D models
 - Villager AI is implemented - they wander within pre-defined location, they look at Player when near and they run from Hostile NPCs (or player)
